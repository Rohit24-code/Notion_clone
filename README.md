if you want a folder inside app that you don't want to be accessed as route even after having a page.tsx init is to use _ in front of it like _components/page.tsx.


An organizational folder is a folder with a () on it like (root) the difference it that it will not act as a route unless we go to a nested folder having page.tsx 


if i have nested () organizational folder and inside (auth)/(routes)/login (routes)/register layout.tsx (root)ant it the route if we write only /login
